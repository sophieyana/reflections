What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It initializes an empty Git repository. It will be used to do commits and see files history.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

staging area: intermediate area; allows you to specify exactly what changes should be committed.
staging area is a copy of the most recent commit until I had changes to it.

How to change user name and user email?

Committer: syana <syana@syana-macbookair.roam.corp.google.com>
Your name and email address were configured automatically based
on your username and hostname. Please check that they are accurate.
You can suppress this message by setting them explicitly:

    git config --global user.name "Your Name"
    git config --global user.email you@example.com

After doing this, you may fix the identity used for this commit with:

    git commit --amend --reset-author

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

The staging area allows you to see the difference between your working directory and the staging area (which represent the last commit). It will therefore help to see if there is (enough) significant/logical changes to make a commit. 

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

If you want to make a different version of your file/program or test an experimental feature, branches can be helpful.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

Helps to visualize the parents of each commit. And the command git log --graph --oneline gives us a visualization of the tree and therefore the different branches.
